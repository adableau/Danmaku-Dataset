# Danmaku-Dataset

Danmaku-Dataset is a large scale dataset crawl from popular video website youKu.com

In online video communities, an emerging source of comment such as danmaku allows viewers to interact when watching. Prior work discussed the feasibility of application using danmaku, while comprehensive analysis on large-scale data is vacant to be filled in.
We here release our danmaku data collection and report interesting observed phenomena in the danmaku comments. This analysis reveals temporal distributions and user's access patterns of online time-sync comments. 

We have built a danmaku crawler and collected the YouKu videos' danmaku information through a combination of YouKu API and scrapes of YouKu video webpage. 
We use three approaches to construct our dataset:
1) We crawl both publicly available traditional video comments and time-sync danmaku comments. 
2) We crawl users and video information for further analysis such as timestamps and video tags. 
3) We further annotate the sentiment label of danmaku comments to better understand the emotion of the users.
We extracted danmaku comments from October, 2017 to April, 2018 and contributed the final datasets.

As shown in Table 2, paper [25], Paper [13], Paper [15] and Paper [11] have involved a large number of danmaku comments to understand video content. Although current data sets have made significant progress in understanding video content and user’s watching behaviors, it is still not close to being widely applied in real scenarios.
We bulid a large-scale dataset includes detailed information on: (1) play time and play mode of the video; (2) creation time and upload time by users; (3) tags
and summarization of TV shows; (4) counts of replies and thumbs-up’s of each traditional comment.
Some statistics of our dataset are shown as follows.

Table 4 lists the numbers and percentages of all danmaku comments.
